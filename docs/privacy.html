    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Ippo MVP — by Legacy of Education, Inc.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Ippo MVP ("the App") is an effort-based running game for Apple Watch and iPhone. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App accesses the following health and fitness data through Apple HealthKit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heart rate</strong> — used to measure effort during runs</li>
        <li><strong>Distance</strong> — used to track run progress</li>
        <li><strong>Active energy burned</strong> — used for workout summaries</li>
        <li><strong>Workouts</strong> — used to log and validate running sessions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is only accessed with your explicit permission through the HealthKit authorization prompt.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your health and fitness data is used exclusively for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sprint validation and effort calculation during gameplay</li>
        <li>Workout tracking and session history</li>
        <li>Rank progression based on running effort</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your data for advertising, analytics profiling, or any purpose unrelated to core app functionality.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your account data and gameplay progress are stored securely on Firebase (Google Cloud Platform). Data is transmitted over encrypted connections (TLS) and stored in compliance with Google Cloud's security standards.</p>
    <p>Health data read from HealthKit is processed on-device and only aggregated metrics (e.g., effort scores, distance totals) are stored server-side. Raw HealthKit data is not uploaded to our servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, or transfer your personal data or health data to any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete your account and all associated data at any time from within the App by navigating to <strong>Settings → Delete Account</strong>. Upon deletion, all your data is permanently removed from our servers.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at:</p>
